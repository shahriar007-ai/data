Reviews	Sentiment
Wow... Loved this place.	pos
Crust is not good.	neg
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	neg
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.	pos
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.	pos
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	neg
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	neg
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.	neg
The fries were great too.	pos
A great touch.	pos
Service was very prompt.	pos
Would not go back.	neg
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	neg
"I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken, with cranberry...mmmm!"	pos
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.	neg
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	neg
Highly recommended.	pos
Waitress was a little slow in service.	neg
"This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas."	neg
did not like at all.	neg
The Burrittos Blah!	neg
"The food, amazing."	pos
Service is also cute.	pos
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.	pos
So they performed.	pos
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.	pos
- They never brought a salad we asked for.	neg
"This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff."	pos
"Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed."	neg
The worst was the salmon sashimi.	neg
"Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal."	pos
This was like the final blow!	neg
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	pos
"seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."	neg
"Overall, I like this place a lot."	pos
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	pos
Ample portions and good prices.	pos
"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table."	neg
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!	pos
Service sucks.	neg
The shrimp tender and moist.	pos
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	neg
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	neg
"On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service."	pos
"Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register."	neg
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	pos
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	neg
"The burger is good beef, cooked just right."	pos
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	pos
"My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing."	pos
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.	pos
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	pos
Their chow mein is so good!	pos
"They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food."	neg
The portion was huge!	pos
"Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu."	pos
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	neg
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	neg
"The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked."	pos
"The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless."	neg
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for posneg minutes.	neg
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!	pos
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.	pos
We'd definitely go back here again.	pos
We are so glad we found this place.	pos
"Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount."	pos
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!	pos
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	pos
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	neg
A great way to finish a great.	pos
"The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected."	pos
"- Really, really good rice, all the time."	pos
The service was meh.	neg
"It took over 3neg min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk."	neg
"I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense."	neg
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	neg
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	neg
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.	pos
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	pos
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	neg
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	neg
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	neg
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	neg
This place has it!	pos
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	neg
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.	pos
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	neg
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!	pos
Omelets are to die for!	pos
Everything was fresh and delicious!	pos
"In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience."	neg
"It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party."	pos
"Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!"	neg
Best breakfast buffet!!!	pos
say bye bye to your tip lady!	neg
We'll never go again.	neg
Will be back again!	pos
Food arrived quickly!	pos
It was not good.	neg
"On the up side, their cafe serves really good food."	pos
"Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!"	pos
"The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming."	pos
"Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it."	pos
"I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious."	pos
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.	pos
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	pos
"The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!"	pos
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.	pos
Will go back next trip out.	pos
Sooooo good!!	pos
"REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good."	neg
"At least 4negmin passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy."	neg
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.	pos
"Nice, spicy and tender."	pos
Good prices.	pos
Check it out.	pos
It was pretty gross!	neg
I've had better atmosphere.	neg
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	neg
"Although I very much Sentiment the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing."	neg
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	neg
"Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries."	neg
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.	pos
"The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten."	pos
"We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night."	pos
"Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!"	neg
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	neg
"Phenomenal food, service and ambiance."	pos
I wouldn't return.	neg
"Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas."	pos
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	neg
Penne vodka excellent!	pos
"They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers."	pos
The management is rude.	neg
"Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even."	pos
"Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations."	pos
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	pos
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	pos
"He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas."	neg
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	pos
Don't do it!!!!	neg
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	neg
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	neg
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	neg
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	pos
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.	pos
"The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow."	neg
"The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace."	neg
I give it 2 thumbs down	neg
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	neg
My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	pos
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.	pos
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	neg
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	neg
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	pos
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.	pos
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	pos
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.	pos
this place is good.	pos
"Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE."	neg
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	neg
I was seated immediately.	pos
"Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced."	pos
Avoid at all cost!	neg
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.	pos
DELICIOUS!!	pos
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	pos
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	neg
I've never been treated so bad.	neg
Bacon is hella salty.	pos
"We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste."	neg
"This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed."	pos
The waitresses are very friendly.	pos
"Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!"	pos
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	pos
"Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back."	neg
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	neg
"The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness."	pos
"Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while."	pos
We literally sat there for 2neg minutes with no one asking to take our order.	neg
"The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor."	neg
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	neg
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	neg
It was probably dirt.	neg
"Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor."	pos
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	pos
"The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined."	neg
Interesting decor.	pos
What I really like there is the crepe station.	pos
"Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good."	pos
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	pos
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.	pos
"When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing."	neg
"I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied."	pos
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	neg
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!	pos
The live music on Fridays totally blows.	neg
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	neg
Very friendly staff.	pos
It is worth the drive.	pos
"I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of."	pos
Food was great and so was the serivce!	pos
The warm beer didn't help.	neg
Great brunch spot.	pos
Service is friendly and inviting.	pos
Very good lunch spot.	pos
I've lived here since pos979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.	neg
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	neg
Must have been an off night at this place.	neg
"The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous."	pos
"If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen."	neg
"For about posneg minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon."	neg
My friend loved the salmon tartar.	pos
Won't go back.	neg
Extremely Tasty!	pos
Waitress was good though!	pos
Soggy and not good.	neg
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.	pos
Which are small and not worth the price.	neg
- the food is rich so order accordingly.	pos
"The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!"	neg
The service was a bit lacking.	neg
"Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables."	neg
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	neg
"It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad."	neg
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.	pos
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!	pos
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.	pos
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."	neg
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!	pos
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.	pos
"If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people."	neg
Very very fun chef.	pos
"Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks."	neg
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.	pos
"If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it."	neg
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."	neg
"I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing)."	pos
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	neg
"Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service."	pos
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	neg
Now this dish was quite flavourful.	pos
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	neg
"(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold."	neg
like the other reviewer said "you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."	neg
-Drinks took close to 3neg minutes to come out at one point.	neg
"Seriously flavorful delights, folks."	pos
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.	pos
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.	pos
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.	neg
Owner's are really great people.!	pos
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.	neg
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.	pos
"Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too."	neg
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.	pos
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.	pos
Fantastic service here.	pos
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	neg
They know how to make them here.	pos
very tough and very short on flavor!	neg
I hope this place sticks around.	pos
"I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water."	neg
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.	pos
"Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!"	pos
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.	pos
"Plus, it's only 8 bucks."	pos
"The service was not up to par, either."	neg
"Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time."	pos
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!	pos
"For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed."	neg
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!	pos
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.	pos
You can't beat that.	pos
"Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff."	pos
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.	pos
"I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho."	neg
I Sentiment the patio and the service was outstanding.	pos
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!	pos
I think not again	neg
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	neg
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.	pos
Service stinks here!	neg
I waited and waited.	neg
"This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant."	neg
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.	pos
Great Pizza and Salads!	pos
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.	neg
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done posnegneg times better at home.	neg
This place is amazing!	pos
"I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place."	neg
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	neg
Just don't know why they were so slow.	neg
"The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection."	pos
"I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location."	neg
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.	pos
"You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care."	pos
Before I go in to why I gave a pos star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.	neg
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.	pos
Never again will I be dining at this place!	neg
The food was excellent and service was very good.	pos
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.	pos
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	neg
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around pos2.	neg
Food was really boring.	neg
Good Service-check!	pos
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!	neg
"Will never, ever go back."	neg
"As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return."	neg
"In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful."	pos
I did not expect this to be so good!	pos
Fantastic food!	pos
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	neg
The food was very good.	pos
Never going back.	neg
"Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made."	pos
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	neg
"By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known."	neg
"Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways."	pos
"And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $2neg, you just can't go wrong."	pos
All the bread is made in-house!	pos
The only downside is the service.	neg
"Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had."	neg
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	pos
"A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal."	pos
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!	pos
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!	pos
You won't be disappointed.	pos
"They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good."	pos
"I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a pos egg breakfast, especially for $4.negneg."	neg
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.	neg
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	neg
"Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back."	pos
"We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere."	pos
Everything was gross.	neg
I love this place.	pos
Great service and food.	pos
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!	neg
The burger... I got the "Gold Standard" a $pos7 burger and was kind of disappointed.	neg
"OMG, the food was delicioso!"	pos
There is nothing authentic about this place.	neg
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	neg
"Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great."	pos
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.	pos
It's worth driving up from Tucson!	pos
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	neg
Pretty good beer selection too.	pos
"This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER."	pos
"Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!"	pos
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!	pos
"I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious."	pos
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	neg
He was terrible!	neg
Everyone is treated equally special.	pos
It shouldn't take 3neg min for pancakes and eggs.	neg
It was delicious!!!	pos
"On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat."	pos
"Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas."	neg
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!	pos
Best fish I've ever had in my life!	pos
(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)	pos
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.	neg
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.	pos
Pretty cool I would say.	pos
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	neg
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.	pos
"I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food."	neg
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.	neg
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.	pos
"The staff are great, the ambiance is great."	pos
He deserves 5 stars.	pos
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	neg
They dropped more than the ball.	neg
"The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable."	pos
"They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!"	pos
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	neg
Best tacos in town by far!!	pos
I took back my money and got outta there.	neg
"In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing."	pos
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.	neg
"The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first posneg minutes."	neg
I won't be back.	neg
They have great dinners.	pos
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.	pos
The food was terrible.	neg
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.	neg
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	neg
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.	pos
This place deserves one star and 9neg% has to do with the food.	neg
This is a disgrace.	neg
Def coming back to bowl next time	pos
"If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place."	pos
I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area.	pos
"I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great."	pos
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.	pos
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.	pos
"To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser."	pos
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	neg
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!	pos
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.	pos
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.	pos
This one is simply a disappointment.	neg
"Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon."	neg
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!	neg
"Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area."	pos
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.	pos
Left very frustrated.	neg
I'll definitely be in soon again.	pos
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.	pos
Service was fantastic.	pos
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.	neg
I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.	pos
"Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!"	pos
"For service, I give them no stars."	neg
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.	pos
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.	neg
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	neg
But now I was completely grossed out.	neg
I really enjoyed eating here.	pos
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.	pos
"Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end."	pos
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.	pos
"On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop."	neg
"Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!"	neg
We've tried to like this place but after posneg+ times I think we're done with them.	neg
What a mistake that was!	neg
No complaints!	pos
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.	pos
Waiter was a jerk.	neg
"Strike 2, who wants to be rushed."	neg
These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.	pos
I never come again.	neg
We loved the biscuits!!!	pos
Service is quick and friendly.	pos
Ordered an appetizer and took 4neg minutes and then the pizza another posneg minutes.	neg
So absolutley fantastic.	pos
It was a huge awkward pos.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.	neg
definitely will come back here again.	pos
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.	pos
Wow very spicy but delicious.	pos
"If you're not familiar, check it out."	pos
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.	neg
I'd love to go back.	pos
"Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch."	pos
Nothing special.	neg
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!	pos
"Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!"	pos
Will not be back.	neg
Sauce was tasteless.	neg
"The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way."	pos
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.	pos
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.	neg
Food was so gooodd.	pos
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.	neg
I was so insulted.	neg
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.	neg
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.	neg
"The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc."	pos
Nargile - I think you are great.	pos
Best tater tots in the southwest.	pos
We loved the place.	pos
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.	neg
The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.	pos
Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.	pos
The manager was the worst.	neg
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.	pos
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.	pos
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	neg
"This is was due to the fact that it took 2neg minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things."	neg
"Love the margaritas, too!"	pos
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.	pos
"Very good, though!"	pos
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.	neg
Great pork sandwich.	pos
Don't waste your time here.	neg
"Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee."	neg
"Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold."	neg
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.	pos
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.	pos
We had a group of 7neg+ when we claimed we would only have 4neg and they handled us beautifully.	pos
I LOVED it!	pos
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.	neg
"This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here."	pos
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	neg
The selection of food was not the best.	neg
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!	pos
"This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment."	pos
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I Sentiment the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	pos
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.	neg
"It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign."	neg
How awesome is that.	pos
I will be back many times soon.	pos
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!	pos
"Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings."	neg
CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.	pos
Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.	pos
And then tragedy struck.	neg
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.	pos
"This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!"	pos
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.	pos
Waitress was sweet and funny.	pos
"I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!"	pos
"I'd rather eat airline food, seriously."	neg
Cant say enough good things about this place.	pos
The ambiance was incredible.	pos
The waitress and manager are so friendly.	pos
I would not recommend this place.	neg
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.	neg
My gyro was basically lettuce only.	neg
Terrible service!	neg
Thoroughly disappointed!	neg
"I don't each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here."	pos
"Give it a try, you will be happy you did."	pos
By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!	pos
Reasonably priced also!	pos
Everything was perfect the night we were in.	pos
The food is very good for your typical bar food.	pos
it was a drive to get there.	neg
"At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff."	pos
"Anyway, I do not think i will go back there."	neg
"Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed."	pos
"Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant."	pos
If you haven't gone here GO NOW!	pos
"A greasy, unhealthy meal."	neg
first time there and might just be the last.	neg
Those burgers were amazing.	pos
"Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late."	neg
And it was way to expensive.	neg
"Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for."	pos
This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.	pos
The bartender was also nice.	pos
Everything was good and tasty!	pos
This place is two thumbs up....way up.	pos
"The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun."	pos
"If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place."	pos
Terrible management.	neg
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.	pos
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.	neg
"Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts."	pos
Worst martini ever!	neg
The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.	pos
I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!	pos
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).	neg
The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.	pos
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.	neg
"No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it."	neg
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.	pos
Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!	pos
"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you."""	neg
The desserts were a bit strange.	neg
My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.	pos
"I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!"	pos
Nice ambiance.	pos
I would recommend saving room for this!	pos
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	neg
"However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good."	neg
"I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!"	neg
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!	neg
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	neg
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!	pos
I *heart* this place.	pos
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.	neg
After two I felt disgusting.	neg
A good time!	pos
I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.	pos
Generous portions and great taste.	pos
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!	neg
"The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an ""Are you being helped?"""	neg
Food was delicious!	pos
AN HOUR... seriously?	neg
I consider this theft.	neg
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.	neg
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.	neg
Waited and waited and waited.	neg
"He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service."	pos
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.	pos
"The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way."	neg
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.	neg
Service was good and the company was better!	pos
The staff are also very friendly and efficient.	pos
"As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks."	pos
Boy was that sucker dry!!.	neg
Over rated.	neg
"If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where."	neg
Their steaks are posnegneg% recommended!	pos
After I pulled up my car I waited for another pos5 minutes before being acknowledged.	neg
Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.	pos
"All in all, I can assure you I'll be back."	pos
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.	neg
"My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar."	pos
The kids play area is NASTY!	neg
Great place fo take out or eat in.	pos
The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.	pos
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.	pos
It was extremely "crumby" and pretty tasteless.	neg
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	neg
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.	pos
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!	neg
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!	pos
I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded. I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.	pos
Not good for the money.	neg
I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!	pos
"We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 4neg minutes just to place our order, another 3neg minutes before the food arrived."	neg
They also have the best cheese crisp in town.	pos
"Good value, great food, great service."	pos
Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.	pos
The food is good.	pos
It was awesome.	pos
I just wanted to leave.	neg
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!	pos
I will not be eating there again.	neg
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!	neg
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.	neg
"The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy."	neg
"Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :("	neg
An absolute must visit!	pos
The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.	pos
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.	neg
"Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a pos star."	neg
They really want to make your experience a good one.	pos
I will not return.	neg
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.	neg
Very disappointing!!!	neg
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.	pos
"a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait."	neg
Pretty awesome place.	pos
Ambience is perfect.	pos
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	neg
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.	neg
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.	neg
"The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!"	pos
Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !	pos
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!	pos
"Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick."	neg
High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.	pos
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.	neg
We were promptly greeted and seated.	pos
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.	neg
"I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable."	pos
"After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods."	neg
This is a good joint.	pos
The Macarons here are insanely good.	pos
I'm not eating here!	neg
"Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative."	pos
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.	neg
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.	neg
Very bad Experience!	neg
What a mistake.	neg
Food was average at best.	neg
Great food.	pos
We won't be going back anytime soon!	neg
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.	neg
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.	pos
It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.	pos
"Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed."	neg
The patio seating was very comfortable.	pos
The fried rice was dry as well.	neg
Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!	pos
That just SCREAMS "LEGIT" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas.	pos
It was just not a fun experience.	pos
The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.	pos
"I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!)."	pos
"Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!"	pos
The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.	pos
Both great!	pos
Eclectic selection.	pos
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.	pos
The staff was very attentive.	pos
And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).	pos
"The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price."	pos
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.	neg
dont go here.	neg
I promise they won't disappoint.	pos
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.	neg
What a great double cheeseburger!	pos
Awesome service and food.	pos
A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!	pos
I can't wait to go back.	pos
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.	neg
It's a great place and I highly recommend it.	pos
Service was slow and not attentive.	neg
"I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now."	pos
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.	neg
Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.	pos
"Very good food, great atmosphere.pos"	pos
Damn good steak.	pos
Total brunch fail.	neg
"Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo."	pos
"The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant."	pos
The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!	pos
"Good food , good service ."	pos
It was absolutely amazing.	pos
"I probably won't be back, to be honest."	neg
will definitely be back!	pos
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.	pos
"Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good."	pos
Went for lunch - service was slow.	neg
"We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed."	neg
I was mortified.	neg
"Needless to say, we will never be back here again."	neg
"Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more."	neg
"The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible."	neg
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	neg
Have been going since 2negneg7 and every meal has been awesome!!	pos
Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.	pos
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.	pos
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.	neg
The atmosphere here is fun.	pos
Would not recommend to others.	neg
Service is quick and even "to go" orders are just like we like it!	pos
"I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!"	neg
"That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased."	pos
Not my thing.	neg
2 Thumbs Up!!	pos
If you are reading this please don't go there.	neg
"I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza."	pos
Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!	pos
They have a really nice atmosphere.	pos
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.	neg
"After one bite, I was hooked."	pos
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.	neg
"Cute, quaint, simple, honest."	pos
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.	pos
"The food was great as always, compliments to the chef."	pos
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.	pos
Awesome selection of beer.	pos
Great food and awesome service!	pos
"One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that."	pos
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	neg
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.	pos
"As for the service, I thought it was good."	pos
"The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us."	neg
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.	neg
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.	pos
"Overall, I like there food and the service."	pos
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.	pos
"Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it."	neg
"Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it."	neg
"Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service."	pos
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.	pos
Never had anything to complain about here.	pos
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.	pos
It was way over fried.	neg
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.	neg
"When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way."	neg
Will not be back!	neg
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	pos
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.	pos
"I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from."	pos
"I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!"	neg
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.	pos
"I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette."	pos
"The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth."	pos
"Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup."	pos
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!	pos
"Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 3negs and up."	neg
"When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!"	pos
I had to wait over 3neg minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.	neg
This is a GREAT place to eat!	pos
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.	pos
The service was poor and thats being nice.	neg
"Food was good, service was good, Prices were good."	pos
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!	neg
"The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather."	neg
But the service was beyond bad.	neg
I'm so happy to be here!!!"	pos
Tasted like dirt.	neg
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .	pos
The block was amazing.	pos
"It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food."	pos
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!	pos
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.	neg
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.	pos
"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."	neg
"What did bother me, was the slow service."	neg
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!	pos
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	neg
These were so good we ordered them twice.	pos
So in a nutshell: pos) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	neg
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.	neg
"Unfortunately, it was not good."	neg
I had a pretty satifying experience.	pos
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.	pos
"Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder."	pos
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	neg
"The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily."	neg
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!	pos
We will not be coming back.	neg
"I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well."	pos
"The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff."	pos
"Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service."	pos
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.	pos
Once your food arrives it's meh.	neg
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.	neg
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.	pos
"My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too."	neg
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.	pos
"The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh."	pos
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	pos
Mediocre food.	neg
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.	pos
I'm super pissd.	neg
And service was super friendly.	pos
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?	neg
This place was such a nice surprise!	pos
They were golden-crispy and delicious.	pos
"I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat."	neg
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.	pos
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.	neg
"Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered."	pos
"The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was."	pos
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	neg
The service was terrible though.	neg
"This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!"	neg
It was packed!!	neg
I love this place.	pos
I can say that the desserts were yummy.	pos
The food was terrible.	neg
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.	pos
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.	neg
This place should honestly be blown up.	neg
But I definitely would not eat here again.	neg
Do not waste your money here!	neg
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.	pos
The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.	pos
Awful service.	neg
Won't ever go here again.	neg
Food quality has been horrible.	neg
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.	neg
The service here is fair at best.	neg
"I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services."	neg
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	neg
Very poor service.	neg
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.	neg
"Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day."	pos
They were excellent.	pos
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.	neg
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.	pos
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	neg
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.	neg
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!	pos
"for 4neg bucks a head, i really expect better food."	neg
The food came out at a good pace.	pos
"I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad."	pos
I won't be back.	neg
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	neg
This place deserves no stars.	neg
I would not recommend this place.	neg
"In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome."	pos
"To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted."	neg
"Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!"	neg
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.	pos
I probably would not go here again.	neg
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.	pos
The price is reasonable and the service is great.	pos
"The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either."	neg
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	neg
"Went in for happy hour, great list of wines."	pos
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!	pos
I probably won't be coming back here.	neg
Worst food/service I've had in a while.	neg
"This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant."	pos
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.	pos
"Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil."	neg
I love their fries and their beans.	pos
Always a pleasure dealing with him.	pos
"They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval."	pos
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	pos
"For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go."	pos
"The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table."	pos
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	neg
"I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one."	neg
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.	neg
"All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting."	pos
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.	pos
Weird vibe from owners.	neg
There was hardly any meat.	neg
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.	neg
Go To Place for Gyros.	pos
"I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!"	pos
"Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless."	neg
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	neg
"The service was terrible, food was mediocre."	neg
We definately enjoyed ourselves.	pos
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.	neg
"On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate."	neg
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	neg
The service was extremely slow.	neg
"After 2neg minutes wait, I got a table."	neg
Seriously killer hot chai latte.	pos
"No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts."	neg
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.	pos
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.	pos
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	neg
Worst Thai ever.	neg
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.	pos
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.	pos
The pizza selections are good.	pos
"I had strawberry tea, which was good."	pos
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	neg
"Overall, a great experience."	pos
Spend your money elsewhere.	neg
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!	pos
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.	neg
"And the drinks are WEAK, people!"	neg
-My order was not correct.	neg
"Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house."	neg
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	neg
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	pos
We won't be returning.	neg
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.	pos
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	neg
"Very, very sad."	neg
"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?"	neg
"How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!"	neg
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.	neg
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.	neg
"There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better"	neg
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	neg
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!	neg
"What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us."	neg
"Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon."	neg
This place is disgusting!	neg
"Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree."	pos
The RI style calamari was a joke.	neg
"However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible."	neg
"I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch."	neg
"It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it."	neg
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.	neg
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!	neg
Disappointing experience.	neg
"The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all."	neg
"If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you."	neg
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.	neg
We won't be going back.	neg
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	neg
This place lacked style!!	neg
"The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $pos2, ridiculous."	neg
Don't bother coming here.	neg
"The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork."	neg
"The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again."	neg
It was equally awful.	neg
Probably not in a hurry to go back.	neg
very slow at seating even with reservation.	neg
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	neg
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	neg
"The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat."	neg
"It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor."	neg
I was VERY disappointed!!	neg
This place is horrible and way overpriced.	neg
"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best."	neg
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	neg
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	neg
"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits."	neg
Con: spotty service.	neg
"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger."	neg
But then they came back cold.	neg
"Then our food came out, disappointment ensued."	neg
The real disappointment was our waiter.	neg
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.	neg
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.	neg
"Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it."	neg
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?	neg
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.	neg
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	neg
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	neg
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.	neg
But I don't like it.	neg
Hell no will I go back	neg
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	neg
"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all""."	neg
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	neg
The ambiance isn't much better.	neg
"Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees."	neg
The food wasn't good.	neg
"Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked."	neg
What happened next was pretty....off putting.	neg
"too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place."	neg
Overpriced for what you are getting.	neg
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	neg
"I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food."	neg
"I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list."	neg
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	neg
Food was below average.	neg
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	neg
"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop."	neg
The problem I have is that they charge $pospos.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	neg
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only pos/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	neg
"It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry."	neg
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.	neg
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.	neg
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.	neg
Spend your money and time some place else.	neg
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.	neg
the presentation of the food was awful.	neg
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	neg
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.	neg
Appetite instantly gone.	neg
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	neg
"The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time."	neg
"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check."	neg
